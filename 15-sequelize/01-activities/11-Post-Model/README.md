* **Folder**: `11-Post-Model/Unsolved`

* **INSTRUCTIONS**:

  The goal of this exercise is to create a Post model using Sequelize.

  **Note**: We still have some code to add in the next exercise to get this app fully functioning, just concentrate on creating the Post model and verifying that you were successful for now.

  **BONUS**

  If you complete the activity before time's up, try adding the following:

  2) A validation to the title so that it must be between 1 and 160 characters.

  3) A validation to the body so that it must be at least 1 character long.

  4) A flag to the category so that it has a default value of "Personal" if a value is not supplied.
